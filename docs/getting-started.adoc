== Extensions

This section is a catalog of Asciidoctor extensions.
In this context, an extension is a library that enriches the AsciiDoc content either by introducing new syntax or weaving additional features into the output.
This differs from tool extensions, such as the Atom extension, which bring AsciiDoc support to the tool.

=== Official Extensions

[cols="1,0,5"]
|====
|Name |Runtime |Description

|http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-diagram[Asciidoctor Diagram]
|Asciidoctor
|A set of extensions for Asciidoctor that allow you to embed diagrams written using the PlantUML, Graphviz, ditaa, or Shaape syntax inside your AsciiDoc documents.

|https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-latex[Asciidoctor LaTeX]
|Asciidoctor
|Makes it possible to convert AsciiDoc documents into LaTeX and HTML.

|Asciidoctor
|An experimental playground for upcoming extensions.
Used to test the capabilities of the extension mechanism and new extension ideas.

|====

NOTE: The label “official” simply means that the extension is hosted inside the Asciidoctor organization on GitHub and is maintained as part of the Asciidoctor project.
In contrast, a third-party extension is one hosted outside of the Asciidoctor organization.
This classification does not indicate the quality of the extension.
Instead, the quality should be based on the extension's own merit.
